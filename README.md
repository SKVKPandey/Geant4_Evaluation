This repository contains the project related to the evaluation round of Geant4 Project by CERN-HSF in GSOC '22.  

This project is basically a Scatter Plot with some animation effects added with the help of d3.js. The repository also contains the CSV File and Jupyter Notebook File that was used for test purposes related to Data Visualization.  

I would like to thanks my project mentors Guilherme Amadio and Bernhard Manfred Gruber for providing me such a beautiful project. 




## Technologies Used For Building Graphy
- d3.js
- CSS-3
- JavaScript
- HTML-5
- Bootstrap-5

## About the Project

- The folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- User need to run the `index.html` file using Live Server feature in VS Code Editor to view the webpage.
- The following would be visible on the screen:

- The Scatter Plot has 'Cycles' Value on the X - Axis and 'Instructions' Value on the Y - Axis.
- Each Tooltip of the Scatter Plot has the color corresponding to their respective Libraries.
- Size of the Circle is proportional to the 'Cycles' Value.
- By hovering the pointer over the Tooltips, one can observe all the values corresponding to it. ( For more clarity about the project, please checkout the Video. )

## About the Jupyter Notebook File

- It contains Scatter Plot and Treemap used for Data Visualization purposes.
- The coding has been done by using Matplotlib.Pyplot and Squarify for creating the Treemap Plot. The sample to it is:
